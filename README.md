# Material Motion Starmap

The Material Motion Starmap is a high level outline of long term plans for
Material Motion over multiple years.

This document is expected to change over time. Please initiate discussions
about this Starmap by [filing an issue]
(https://github.com/material-motion/starmap/issues/) on the GitHub repository.

This repository is neither a schedule nor a list of relative priorities. This
repository is the goal state we want to get to and will help us measure
success. We will publish Roadmaps for individual projects as they spin up.
