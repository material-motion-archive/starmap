# Material Motion Starmap

The Material Motion Starmap is a high level outline of long term plans for
Material Motion over multiple years.

This document is expected to change over time. Please initiate discussions about
this Starmap by [filing an issue
](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-starmap/issues/) on the GitHub repository.

This repository is neither a schedule nor a list of relative priorities. This
repository is the goal state we want to get to and will help us measure success.
We will publish Roadmaps for individual projects as they spin up.

## Motivation

Interactivity and motion play an important role in software interfaces, yet
there is often a gap between what a software creator can imagine and what can be
built in production code.

Material Motion aspires to empower creators with the language and tools to
describe and implement rich, interactive motion.

This Starmap is the first step toward achieving this aspiration. Within, you
will find concepts that cover software design patterns, essential primitives,
specifications for motion runtimes, and much more; all of which are based
heavily upon the experience of shipping production software interfaces.

Each concept in the Starmap represents a concrete **goal** — a guiding star — to
guide development.

The Starmap also serves as an index of concept implementations. An ideal
implementation is one that complements and amplifies the power of a specific
platform’s toolchain, has minimal dependencies, and is well documented.

## Table of contents

This repository is organized by the following high-level concepts:

1. [Primitives](concepts/primitives.md): Essential building blocks of motion.
1. [Patterns](concepts/patterns.md): Essential software design patterns.
1. [Runtimes](concepts/runtimes.md): Specification for building declarative motion engines.
1. [Expressions](concepts/expressions.md): Specification for concise expression of motion.
1. [Languages](concepts/languages.md): Terms in languages of interactive motion.
1. [Hypotheticals](concepts/hypotheticals.md): Goal experiences.
1. [Applications](concepts/applications.md): Tools for expressing and exploring interactive motion.
1. [Glossary](concepts/glossary.md): Definitions of terminology within the Starmap.
